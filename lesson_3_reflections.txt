When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Most use of this will be as collaborating with other people on a project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If there is a bug in the code, I won't pulling or push it automatically. When I fix it, there I pull/push my code manually.
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
With branches the new changes are added in the same repository.  Forking and cloning both copy an entire repository to a new location.  The difference between forking and cloning is that forking is a special construct made by GitHub.
