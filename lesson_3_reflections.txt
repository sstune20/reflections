When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Most use of this will be as collaborating with other people on a project.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
If there is a bug in the code, I won't pulling or push it automatically. When I fix it, there I pull/push my code manually.
